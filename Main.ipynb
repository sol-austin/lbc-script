    "<p>It takes in 4 parameters. Scores: the previously generated array of scores. Matcher: the 5(ish) second clip we're searching for. Threshold: a value often around 200 which the correlation score must be above for us to assume the clips are the same (and assume we have found the location of the adverts intro/outro). Frames - the original array of the 3 hour show split into 5 second clips.</p>\n",

    "<p>We create two empty arrays to start with. 'done_times' and 'ret_times'. We then loop through the previously generated array of scores (given as an input) backwards.</p>\n",
    "<p>'done_times' will hold any times that we've marked as intro/outro (where the ads begin) to the nearest minute. This will later ensure that we don't mark any minutes multiple times. For example, if the intro is playing over 5 seconds and we check every individual second within that time, we could mark that timestamp 5 times which would be unneccesary.</p>\n",
    "<p>'ret_times' will hold any times that we've marked as intro/outro, similarly to 'done_times', but to a much more precise value. We will return 'ret_times' and use this to cut out the adverts as it is to the nearest second not the nearest minute.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Firstly, we check that the current value is greater than the threshold we have set. If it is less, for example the threshold is 200 and the correlation between the current 5 second clip and the advert intro/outro is only 150, we discard this value and move on. Assuming it is greater than the threshold, we continue with this value.</p>\n",
    "<p>We calculate how far through the 3 hour show this value is found using a short formula as a decimal where 0 is the start and 1 is the end (3 hours in).</p>\n",
    "<p>We then use a short function to calculate the number of hours, minutes and seconds into the show and save into hours, mins and secs variables respectively.</p>\n",
    "<p>We check if the value is in 'done_times', meaning we have already marked it using the hours and minutes. If it is, we 'continue' to the next value and return to the start of the loop for the next value.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Assuming the value isn't in 'done_times', we keep going and add the value to 'done_times' so we don't duplicate it later. We also add the accurate value to 'ret_times' to help us edit the 3 hour show. We print the current index and value for debugging purposes as well as the hours and minutes to the user. We save the short clip to a file to double check it matches the intro/outro</p>\n",
